"INEVITABLE" - 3D Maze Chase Game - Created using Unity

INEVITABLE is a 3D maze chase game, in which the player is sent into the maze to capture the running humanoid creature with some sphere-shaped allies to help, and also to collect all the points.

• Collect Points to get a score before the creature collects them.

• Collect Potions to prevent the creature from collecting them to activate the turn condition, and get more scores.

• Capture the Creature to get more scores before the Allies capture it.

• Locate the Creature by listening to its footstep or following the Allies’ moving path.

• Teleport from the left side of the maze to the right side, and vice versa.

• In the turn condition, the Creature will chase and damage you, so run away from it.

• Colliding with the Allies will also damage you.

• Unlocked the next level by reaching the high score threshold.
